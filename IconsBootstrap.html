<!--In Bootstrap 3+ there are more than 260 Glyphicons. These icons are font-based
which give you more control over their color. To use these types of icons is
pretty straightforward, you would use the general syntax:-->

<!--<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-class-name"></span>-->

<!--For example, if you wanted to create a delete button with an icon, it would look like this:-->

<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-trash"></span> Delete</button>


You can find the icon used here and more on the official Glyphicon website http://glyphicons.com/.
